SurpriseProbing:

A simple set of scripts to extract Wav2vec2 loss based on sequences generated by the ControlledStim dataset 
(https://github.com/PierreOrhan/ControlledStim).
Make sure to have install the ControlledStim dataset:
        
        cd yourpath/ControlledStim
        pip install -e ./

This repository was developed purely for replication purposes and is not meant to be extended.

The ANN package subclass Huggingface implementation of Wav2vec2, correcting for a few issues.
The probe package provides the loss.

System requirements:
        Same hardware requirements as the Transformers python package.
        
        The software was tested in torch 2.0.1. 
        Make sure to have torch < 2.0.1 as the loading of the transformers Wav2vec2 models might otherwise fail.

        
Installation:


        cd yourpath/StructureProbing
        pip install -e ./
